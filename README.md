# My Solution the Babysitter Kata

## Background
Read the Babysitter.Problem-Statement.README.md to see the
problem statement for this Kata.

This is my attempt at solving the Kata using Python 2.7.
I am also using gradle to provide some simple tasks for
running the tests and various things with the simple application.

## Running the tests
You can run the tests by executing 

```bash
foo@bar:~$ python test_babysitter.py
```

or

``` 
foo@bar:~$ gradlew test
```

## Potential Enhancements
Including a way to redefine the babysitting hour range, rather than have it hard coded.
